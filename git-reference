git issue:
git -c http.sslVerify=false clone https://github.com/dhananjay762/automation-framework.git
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11621768/how-can-i-make-git-accept-a-self-signed-certificate)

if git repository is in control:
git config http.sslVerify false

while installing protractor with npm: (if error = unable to verify the first certificate)
npm config set strict-ssl false
npm install -g protractor
npm config set strict-ssl true

(looks like https://registry.npmjs.org/ the certificate is not trusted behind the proxy

my solution for this was to set the registry to the http version in config)

npm cache clean
webdriver-manager update --ignore_ssl
